# Implementation Plan: Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `002-humanoid-robotics-book`
**Date**: 2025-12-07
**Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-humanoid-robotics-book/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the process for creating a 4-module book on Humanoid Robotics. The project will follow a structured, module-by-module writing approach, with each module covering a core area of robotics. The final output will be a Docusaurus website deployed to GitHub Pages, containing the full text of the book, including diagrams, code examples, and citations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (Docusaurus v3)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React.js (for custom components), Gemini CLI
**Storage**: N/A (Content managed in Git repository)
**Testing**: Manual validation against constitution standards, technical peer review of content, and automated link checking.
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (via Docusaurus deployment)
**Project Type**: Documentation
**Constraints**: As defined in the constitution: 20,000-30,000 words, ROS 2 Humble, APA 7th edition citations.
**Scale/Scope**: 4 modules plus a capstone project description.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Technical Accuracy**: All explanations of robotics, control systems, simulations, and AI methodologies must be factually correct and derived from authoritative sources.
- [ ] **Clarity**: Content must be understandable for students with a computer science or AI background.
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: All tutorials, code examples, and robotics workflows must be replicable.
- [ ] **Alignment with Physical AI**: Every module must emphasize embodied intelligence.
- [ ] **Rigor**: Preference must be given to robotics engineering literature, official documentation, and peer-reviewed sources.
- [ ] **APA 7th Edition**: All citations must be in APA 7th edition format.
- [ ] **Plagiarism Tolerance 0%**: All content must be original and pass plagiarism scans.
- [ ] **Final Publish Format**: The final output must be a Docusaurus site deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

The book content will be organized within a Docusaurus project structure.

**Structure Decision**: A standard Docusaurus v3 project will be initialized in a `book/` directory at the repository root. Each module will be a separate markdown file within the `docs/` directory.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations of the constitution are anticipated.
