I'm unable to build the Docusaurus site because the `yarn` command is not recognized. Please ensure Yarn is installed and accessible in your system's PATH. I cannot proceed with the remaining implementation tasks until this is resolved.

**Please install Yarn and then re-run the `/sp.implement` command.**
