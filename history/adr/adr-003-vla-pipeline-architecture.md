# ADR-003: VLA Pipeline Architecture for Humanoid Robotics Book

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-12-07
- **Feature:** 002-humanoid-robotics-book
- **Context:** The book will cover Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines. A key architectural decision is whether to focus on a modular pipeline (e.g., Whisper -> LLM -> Action) or an end-to-end model. This decision impacts educational clarity, modularity, performance, and implementability.

## Decision

The optimal VLA pipeline architecture (modular vs. end-to-end) for the book's educational context is pending research.

## Consequences

### Positive

To be filled after research.

### Negative

To be filled after research.

## Alternatives Considered

- Modular pipeline (Whisper -> LLM -> Action)
- End-to-end VLA model
