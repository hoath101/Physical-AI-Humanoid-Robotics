# ADR-001: Simulation Technology Selection for Humanoid Robotics Book

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-12-07
- **Feature:** 002-humanoid-robotics-book
- **Context:** The book needs to recommend and demonstrate the use of a simulation platform for humanoid robots. There are several options with different trade-offs in realism, performance, ease of use, and ROS 2 integration (Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim).

## Decision

The decision on the primary simulation technology (or combination) for the book is pending research.

## Consequences

### Positive

To be filled after research.

### Negative

To be filled after research.

## Alternatives Considered

- Gazebo
- Unity
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
