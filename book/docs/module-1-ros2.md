# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Introduction
[Content for Introduction to Module 1: This section will introduce ROS 2, its role as a robotic middleware, and its importance in building complex robotic systems, especially for humanoid robots. It will cover the core philosophy and architecture of ROS 2.]

## Core Concepts
[Content for Core Concepts: This section will dive into the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and actions. It will explain how these components interact to form a distributed robotic system. Diagrams illustrating the ROS graph and communication patterns will be included.]

## Tools & Frameworks
[Content for Tools & Frameworks: This section will focus on `rclpy` for Python-ROS bridging, enabling users to write ROS 2 applications in Python. It will also cover the basics of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for describing the kinematics and visuals of humanoid robots.]

## Applied Workflow
[Content for Applied Workflow: This section will provide a step-by-step guide to creating a basic ROS 2 package, defining custom messages, and implementing simple publisher/subscriber nodes. It will demonstrate how to launch and inspect the ROS graph.]

## Mini Project
[Content for Mini Project: A small project involving a simulated two-wheeled robot controlled via ROS 2 topics. Students will implement basic movement commands and read sensor data from the simulated environment.]

## Summary & References
[Summary: This module provided an essential foundation in ROS 2, covering its core concepts, Python integration with `rclpy`, and robot description using URDF. This knowledge is crucial for developing sophisticated humanoid robot behaviors.
