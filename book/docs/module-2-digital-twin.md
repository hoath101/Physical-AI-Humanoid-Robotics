# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction
[Briefly introduce the concept of digital twins in robotics, their importance for development and testing, and how Gazebo and Unity serve as key platforms for creating them for humanoid robots.]

## Core Concepts
[Explain fundamental concepts of physics simulation (gravity, collisions, rigid bodies) and sensor simulation (LiDAR, IMU, depth cameras). Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different simulation engines.]

## Tools & Frameworks
[Focus on Gazebo and Unity as primary simulation environments. Detail their respective strengths and how they integrate with ROS 2. Cover basic setup and configuration for both platforms.]

## Applied Workflow
[Provide a step-by-step guide on creating a digital twin of a simple humanoid robot: importing a URDF model into Gazebo, adding simulated sensors, and setting up basic controls. Demonstrate how to visualize Gazebo data in Unity.]

## Mini Project
[A project where students create a simulated environment in Gazebo with obstacles and a simple humanoid robot. The robot will use simulated sensors to detect obstacles and navigate a basic path.]

## Summary & References
[Summary: This module provided a deep dive into creating and utilizing digital twins using Gazebo and Unity. We explored physics and sensor simulation, and their integration with ROS 2, which are critical for safe and efficient robotic development.
