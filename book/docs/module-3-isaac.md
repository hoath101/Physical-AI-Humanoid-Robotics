# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Introduction
[Briefly introduce NVIDIA Isaac Sim as a powerful platform for photorealistic robotic simulation and AI development, specifically for humanoid robots. Highlight its integration with ROS 2.]

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
[Explain core concepts of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, including its USD (Universal Scene Description) based environment, synthetic data generation, and physics simulation capabilities. Introduce VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and its importance for autonomous navigation.]

<h2>Tools & Frameworks</h2>
[Focus on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. Detail how Isaac ROS provides GPU-accelerated packages for robotics applications, including VSLAM and Nav2 integration for humanoid locomotion. Explain the workflow for generating synthetic data for AI training.]

<h2>Applied Workflow</h2>
[Provide a step-by-step guide on importing a humanoid robot into Isaac Sim, configuring its sensors, and setting up a basic VSLAM pipeline using Isaac ROS. Demonstrate how to integrate with Nav2 for path planning and autonomous navigation in a simulated environment.]

<h2>Mini Project</h2>
[A project where students use Isaac Sim to train a simple navigation agent using reinforcement learning (RL) on synthetic data. The agent will learn to avoid obstacles and reach a target location in a simulated maze.]

<h2>Summary & References</h2>
[Summary: This module explored NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, demonstrating their power for photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, VSLAM, and integration with Nav2. These tools are crucial for developing advanced AI capabilities for humanoid robots.
