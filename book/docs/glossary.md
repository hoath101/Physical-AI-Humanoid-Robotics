# Glossary

This section provides definitions for key technical terms used throughout the Humanoid Robotics Book.

## A
**Action (ROS 2)**: A type of ROS 2 communication that enables long-running, goal-oriented tasks. Clients send goals, receive feedback, and get results.

## D
**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: A middleware standard for publish-subscribe communication, used by ROS 2 for real-time data exchange.
**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system (e.g., a humanoid robot) that updates in real-time with data from its physical counterpart.

## G
**Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robotics simulator that accurately simulates complex environments, physics, and sensor data.

## I
**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body.
**Isaac ROS**: A collection of GPU-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that leverage NVIDIA's hardware for high-performance robotics applications.
**Isaac Sim**: A scalable, photorealistic robotics simulation platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, used for training and testing AI-powered robots.

## L
**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser light to measure distances, generating precise 3D information about an environment.
**LLM (Large Language Model)**: An artificial intelligence model that has been trained on a vast amount of text data and can generate human-like text, understand context, and perform various language-related tasks.

## N
**Nav2**: The ROS 2 navigation stack, providing tools for mobile robots to navigate autonomously in an environment, including path planning, localization, and obstacle avoidance.
**Node (ROS 2)**: An executable process in ROS 2 that performs computation (e.g., a sensor driver, a controller).

## R
**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing operating system-like services such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, inter-process messaging, and package management.
**rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2, allowing developers to write ROS 2 nodes and applications using Python.

## S
**Service (ROS 2)**: A type of ROS 2 communication for request/reply interactions between nodes. A client sends a request, and the service node processes it and returns a response.
**Simulation**: The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time, often used in robotics for testing algorithms and behaviors safely.

## T
**Topic (ROS 2)**: A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in a publish-subscribe communication model.

## U
**Unity**: A cross-platform game engine often used for creating 3D simulations and visualizations, including robotics applications via its Robotics Hub.
**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format used in ROS to describe all aspects of a robot model, including its kinematic and dynamic properties, visual appearance, and collision properties.

## V
**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A multidisciplinary field combining computer vision, natural language processing, and robot control to enable robots to understand visual scenes and natural language instructions to perform actions.
**VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technology that allows a robot or device to simultaneously map an unknown environment and determine its own location within that environment using only visual input.

## W
**Whisper**: An open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI, capable of transcribing speech into text in multiple languages.
